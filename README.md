# Hi there! 👋 I'm Mimi!

Welcome to my GitHub! 
I’m a **self-taught web developer** on a journey from civil engineering to the world of software development. I love solving problems, building meaningful projects, and always challenging myself to learn more.

### 🌱 A Bit About My Journey
I started in civil engineering but quickly realized my passion lies in tech. Since then, I’ve gone deep into **web development** and have been exploring the vast possibilities of building digital products. My goal is to transition fully into software development and contribute to impactful projects.

### 🛠️ What I Currently Work With
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Tailwind CSS
- **State Management:** React Hooks, Context API
- **Tools & Platforms:** Git, GitHub, IndexedDB, REST APIs

### 🚀 What I’m Learning Next
I’m constantly pushing myself to learn new technologies by diving into projects that challenge me. Here’s what’s next on my list:
- **Firebase:** I’ll be learning Firebase while building a full-stack entertainment web app with React. This project will include features like movie catalogs, watchlists, and more.
- **Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL:** My goal is to build my first custom backend API and database with this stack to power some future apps.
- **React Native:** I’m excited to eventually bring some of my web projects to mobile!
- **Vue :** Because there's no such thing as knowing too much.

### 💻 Current Projects
- **"Glos" - A Dictionary Web App:** This app goes beyond just definitions—think synonyms, antonyms, voice search, and even bookmarking features with IndexedDB.
- **CV Generator App:** A straightforward project where I’m using **React, Tailwind, html2canvas, and jsPDF** to create a user-friendly tool for generating CVs.
- **Entertainment Web App:** This is where I’m learning Firebase. It’s a movie catalog app built with React where users can explore movies, add them to their watchlists, and even categorize lists.

### ✨ My Future Plans
- Build more full-stack applications to get comfortable with both frontend and backend development.
- Learn C, Python and Solidity
- Contribute to open-source projects to give back to the community and grow as a developer.
- Secure a role where I can apply my skills, keep learning, and collaborate with a team to create awesome products.

### 🌍 A Little More About Me
I’m driven by curiosity and a desire to create. As someone who’s making a career switch, I’m no stranger to challenges, but I see them as opportunities to grow.

### ⚡ Fun fact
- I love cats!
- When I’m not coding, I’m hanging out with my friends, reading a novel, watching anime/Kdramas, or trying out editorial makeup and face painting.
